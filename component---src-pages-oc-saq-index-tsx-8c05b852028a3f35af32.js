The Witch of Words dedicated her life to researching and recording this form of magic, working tirelessly day and night, to the unfortunate point of exhaustion.

Most of the time, he prefers to indulge in books and writing instead.\\n\\nQuille has very low self esteem in regards to his intelligence.
