  title: One Night Murder
  genre: Mystery, Supernatural, Romance(?)
  description: |
    One day, Hotaru wakes up in an unknown mansion with five other girls. None of them claim to know what's going on but everyone's bent on trying to leave. It's too bad Hotaru's got a knack for unlucky timings because suddenly there's a dead body on the floor and they're holding the knife.

    Active project to turn this into an adventure visual novel with 6 chapters. In the past, I had an hour long prologue demo done, but I've been revamping it.
