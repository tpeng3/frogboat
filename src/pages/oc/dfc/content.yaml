    Australia's always been known for its weird, deadly animals so no one was truly surprised on the day giant monsters burst out from the sea, space, and gaps of time. Rather, why not capitalize on it? And thus, the monster hunting hero industry was born. This story is centered around a group of superpowered kids growing up in alternate Sydney learning to deal with adolescence, and ins and outs of their society.

    I like to imagine this project as a short collection of nonlinear stories, or just a 4koma, but right now it's shelved for other priorities. But TLDR, the project where I channel "lost teens struggling in a world of hypercapitalism"

oc seven:
  title: Seven
  quote: >
    "How lucky of me to own a superpower."
  description: |
    Growing up, he dreamed of becoming a superhero that will put bad guys in their place. Too bad when the time came, he found out his superpower is to manipulate luck- a power that's far too self-serving and unpredictable to give him a good reputation in the hero industry. But if you ever want to bankrupt a casino, you found the right guy.

    Outwardly, Seven's a laidback boy who enjoys cringe culture and finds humor in irony. Deep down, he cares more about other's well being than his own, and is quick to fake a smile or lie if the occasion calls for it. His good intentions to grin and bare all his troubles goes unappreciated by his honest friends. Seven's also got a heavy case of imposter syndrome, believing to owe success to his luck, rather than any effort made on his part.

    - Seven is birthed out of my terrible love for gachas, casinos, and anything luck related.

oc aster:
  title: Aster
  quote: >
    "Don't you think superheroes are kinda overrated? Not that my opinion matters..."
  description: |
    He never wanted to be a superhero. For one thing, he's not about to risk his life for some stranger. It's a lot more lucrative to work in tech with the companies that provide equipment to heroes instead. But for now, Aster will spend his time half stuck to a wall until he can control his intangibility powers.

    Aster has pretty low self-esteem and holds a bad impression of superheroes, thinking they're often too weak and trivial. Despite that, he's in a program for heroes to help him control his powers. Though a hard worker, it's often hard to take him seriously. For one thing, he really does try too hard to act "cool".

    Intangibility is incredibly useful as a superpower, but Aster hates it because it tends to only act up when he feels negative emotions. The thought that the organization would try to weaponize his body dysphoria makes him sick.

        I know my best friend complains about the hero job, but it's hard to hide that heart of gold. He actually works the hardest out of all of us. It's why I like him so m- Oh sorry, I almost started to ramble.
    - charKey: oc patti
      testimony: >
        Man, it's annoying to always be the go-to person when someone's trying to look for my invisible best friend. Our freaky situation means I always know what that guy is thinking, but well... He isn't the worst person to be around.

  facts:
    - my trans sonion
    - School-wise, he studies his butt off to maintain straight A's. Unfortunately, he comes in second when compared to the geniuses.
    - Likes "anti-hero" stories thinking that they're "less cliche". Aster is very much an edgy hipster.
    - Characters that are hard workers but nothing ever goes their way... grab my heart very easily.

oc patti:
  title: Patti
  quote: >
    "Yeah my superpower is 'bout empathy but I'd rather have you feel my fist."
  description: |
    A hot-headed girl whose superpower clashes with her personality. She hasn't mastered controlling it, so she often get headaches leaving her fairly volatile. Despite all this, Patti aims to get into the hero industry. She likes the idea of beating up irritating guys.

    Because of her straightforwardness and honesty, she really hates it when people complicate things with deception. Her biggest pet peeve is when people like Seven try to hide something from her, especially because her power makes it obvious when he's lying. Coincidentally, she's pretty good at handling kids.

  quote: >
    "I'm pretty sure there's some child labor laws in violation just by my presence here."
  description: |
    He's not a shy kid, but his lack of social skills makes him hard to approach. It doesn't help when he has such a cheeky tongue. However, he's a sweet boy when he opens up to others.

    Nova's gifted with the ability to manipulate gravity, making him a target for many hero associations. He hated the pressure and almost developed a mistrust for the hero industry. But after meeting Curry though, he decided to stay around.
