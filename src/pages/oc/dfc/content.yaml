    Australia's always been known for its weird, deadly animals so no one was truly surprised on the day giant monsters burst out from the sea, space, and gaps of time in the smack dab of Sydney harbor. Rather, why not capitalize on it? And thus, the monster hunting hero industry was born.

    This story is centered around a group of superpowered kids growing up in an alternate future learning to deal with adolescence, and ins and outs of their society.

    I like to imagine this project as a short collection of nonlinear stories, or just a 4koma, but right now it's shelved for other priorities. But TLDR, the project where I channel "lost teens struggling in a world of hypercapitalism"

oc seven:
  title: Seven
  quote: >
    "How did I end up in the Dragonfly division? ...Well, I got lucky."
  description: |
    Growing up, he dreamed of becoming a superhero that will put bad guys in their place. Too bad his ability has nothing to do with justice and all to do with luck- a power that's far too self-serving and unpredictable to give him a good reputation in the hero industry. But if you ever want to bankrupt a casino, you found the right guy.

    Outwardly, Seven's a laidback boy who enjoys cringe culture and ironic humor. To describe him as repressed is an understatement.

    He cares more about another's well being more than his own, and is quick to fake a smile or lie if the occasion calls for it. Of course, his good intentions to grin and bare all his troubles goes unappreciated by his honest friends.

    Seven's also got a heavy case of imposter syndrome, believing to owe any personal success to his luck, rather than any effort made on his part.

      testimony: >
        "Actually I've heard about Seven before I joined the Dragonfly division. He's banned by the government from a lot of places so I didn't expect the hero in person to be so... easygoing."
  facts:
    - Bi and has a terrible crush on his best friend, Aster
    - Has a younger sister currently in middle school
    - School wise, heâ€™s afraid to give effort so he usually passes with a C, unless the test is multiple choice.
    - His ability actually has to do with manipulating probabilities (but early on, he has trouble controlling this)
    - Likes to play video games and has an online friend who's also a hero-in-training
    - 100% memer. Will unironically wear crocs AND socks with sandals
    - One of my favorite kids mainly because he's my punching bag for when I project a case of impostor syndrome
    - Seven is birthed out of my terrible love for gachas, casinos, and anything luck related.

oc aster:
  title: Aster
  quote: >
    "Don't you think superheroes are kinda overrated? Not that my opinion matters..."
  description: |
    He never wanted to be a superhero. For one thing, why would anyone want to risk their life for some stranger? It's a lot more lucrative to work in tech with the companies that sells equipment to heroes instead. But for now, Aster will spend his time half stuck to a wall until he can control his intangibility powers.

    Aster struggles with self-image and holds a bad impression of superheroes, often thinking they're too weak and trivial. Despite that, he's in a program for heroes to help him control his powers.

    Though a hard worker, it's hard to take him seriously. For one thing, he really does try too hard to act "cool".

    Intangibility is incredibly useful as a superpower, but Aster hates it because it tends to only act up when he feels negative emotions. The thought that the organization would try to weaponize his dysphoria makes him sick.

oc patti:
  title: Patti
  quote: >
    "Yeah so what if I'm an empath? I'd rather have you feel my fist."
  description: |
    A hot-headed girl whose superpower clashes with her personality. She hasn't mastered controlling it, so she often get headaches, leaving her fairly volatile.

    Despite all this, Patti aims to get into the hero industry. She likes the idea of beating up irritating guys.

    Because of her straightforward and honest personality, she despises people who complicates a situations with deception. Her biggest pet peeve is when people like Seven try to hide something from her, especially because her power makes it obvious when he's lying.

    Coincidentally, she's pretty good at handling kids.

oc nova:

  quote: >
    "The fact that I've been brought to this facility means I'm pretttty sure there's some child labor laws in violation."
  description: |
    He's not a shy kid, but his lack of social skills makes him hard to approach. It doesn't help when he has such a cheeky tongue. However, he's a sweet boy when he opens up to others.

    Nova's gifted with the ability to manipulate gravity, making him a target for many hero associations. He hated the pressure and almost developed a mistrust for the hero industry. But after meeting Curry though, he decided to stay around.
