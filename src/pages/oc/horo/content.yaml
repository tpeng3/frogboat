    Fate decided to bring five Asian American high schoolers and a meteor together on one cold night during a camping trip. But what awaited them wasn't the afterlife, but the Land of Night - a vast dreamscape filled with bright stars and dark creatures hiding under known as the Restless. It's not a safe world, and the five friends have to use weapons based on their star-aligned zodiac in order to fight for their right to return home... if that's what they want to do.

      Superrr self indulgent on and off WIP project where I just wanted to make a roguelike game with cooking and friend support mechanics.

    - she's an idol... yeah
    - I designed her with all my drawing weaknesses (glasses, hair, muscles, frilly outfits) in mind so this is my least favorite OC.
