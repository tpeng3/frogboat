Too bad when the time came, he found out his superpower is to manipulate luck- a power that\'s far too self-serving and unpredictable to give him a good reputation in the hero industry. But if you ever want to bankrupt a casino, you found the right guy.\\n\\nOutwardly, Seven\'s a laidback boy who enjoys cringe culture and finds humor in irony. Deep down, he cares more about other\'s well being than his own, and is quick to fake a smile or lie if the occasion calls for it. His good intentions to grin and bare all his troubles goes unappreciated by his honest friends. Seven\'s also got a heavy case of imposter syndrome, believing to owe success to his luck, rather than any effort made on his part.\\n","mainImg":"http://pestemon.weebly.com/uploads/2/8/6/2/28624773/editor/seeevevne.png","relationships":[{"charKey":"oc aster","testimony":"\\"Oh you mean my dumb, apathetic, selfish, impractical, two-faced bastard of a best friend?

Despite that, he\'s in a program for heroes to help him control his powers. Though a hard worker, it\'s often hard to take him seriously. For one thing, he really does try too hard to act \\"cool\\".\\n\\nIntangibility is incredibly useful as a superpower, but Aster hates it because it tends to only act up when he feels negative emotions.
