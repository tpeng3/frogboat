- clean up code (remove commented out stuff)
- if hosting images gets to be too much, move them to external links
- add tooltip to a random page, bc fun shenan...


BUGS:
- on mobile, I need to add overflow scroll to the texts when they get too long

Eventually I should add other OC links

Also a blog post page

shuttlefrog.com can be repurposed to a generic personal site (so /oc is purely for ocs)
blog posts can go to shuttlefrog.com/blog
